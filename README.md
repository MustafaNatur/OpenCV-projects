# Face detection

#### About
This project detect faces in images as well as videos using Haar Cascades in OpenCV and Python.
The xml markup language is designed for convenient encoding and reading of information in a machine and manual way. The file structure and its parameters are specified using tags, attributes and preprocessors

#### Steps

* open xml file
* open img or video file
* set colour filter
* set rectangle
* show result
* the Q button stops the video

#### Results

# Warp perspective

#### About
This project detect faces in images as well as videos using Haar Cascades in OpenCV and Python.
The xml markup language is designed for convenient encoding and reading of information in a machine and manual way. The file structure and its parameters are specified using tags, attributes and preprocessors

#### Steps

* set points coordinates on image (for example in Photoshop)
* make matrix for input data
* make matrix for output data
* use warp perspective function (OpenCV func)
* draw green lines and red points
* show result

#### Results
